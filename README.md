# Advanced CSS Challenge - Professional Portfolio

Wrote the HTML and CSS for a professional portfolio similar to the wireframe given in the rubric.
I've applied my learnings from Modules #1 and #2 to create the CSS and HTML for the portfolio.

- The page is divided into several sections including 'About Me', 'My Work', 'Contact Me'.
- Navigation Links to each section is provided at the top of the page.
- A photo of myself is provided above the 'About Me' section, along with a Quote that inspires me to keep trying (to learn)
- My Work section lists my professional Work Experience - the Companies where I have worked at and the Titles along with Company logos.
- I will add a section for my Web Development experience, as I develop more full-stack applications during this bootcamp.
- I've included event listeners when user hovers over different elements on the page.
- The page is styled to adapt to different screen sizes.
